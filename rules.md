# X-Team 007 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

Assign: Check every teammates' strength and weakness and every one volunteer to take their own task within two days of the dilivery of the team task.

Reassign: In case there may be some disagreement in the assignment, reassignment will be made at every teammate present and after discussion, taking the progress has been made into consideration.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

During the assignment section, everyone also set up their own shedule for the assignment, and during their own due date, they need to tell the teammates what their progress.

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Small problems can be solved throw online chat, and during the weekly meeting we can solve the difficulties together.
Emergency difficulties can be discussed through video meeting.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Let teammates know regularly what your progress, what your difficulties, if there is some possibilities that you could not follow your shedule, let the teammate know and help the sooner, the better.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
