# X-Team 007 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

* Assign: Check every teammates' strength and weakness and everyone volunteer to take their own task within two days learning the team task.

* Reassign: In case there may be some disagreement in the assignment, reassignment will be made with every teammate present and after discussion, taking the progress that has been made into consideration.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

During the assignment section, everyone will also set up their own shedule for the assignment, and at their own due date, they need to tell the teammates what their progress is.

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Small problems can be solved through online chat, and during the weekly meeting we can solve any difficulties together.
Emergency difficulties can be discussed through video meeting or group chat.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Let teammates know regularly what your progress is, what your difficulties are, if there is some possibility that you could not follow your shedule, let teammates know and help the sooner, the better.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
1. Make sure everyone feels accepted and competent
2. Always reply to the message
3. Inform any difficulty in time and ask for help
4. Update progress regularly
